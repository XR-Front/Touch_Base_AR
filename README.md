# Touch Base AR

Touch Base AR is an Augmented Reality application that allows users to view architectural construction details in 3D to help understand how they are assembled.
Architectural details may be animated in order to explain their assembly logic or broaden the user's understanding of architecture. 
Models can be uploaded and downloaded with Google Drive links that can be shared with clients, contractors, or architects in order to easily share a diverse array of three-dimensional assets.

The application is developed using the Unity Game Engine and is still a work-in-progress. Please feel free to reach out if you would like to collaborate on this effort or share any ideas!
